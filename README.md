# Boot.dev's Computer Science Curriculum for Backend Developers

‚≠ê Hit the project with a star if you find it useful! ‚≠ê

This is a living roadmap for [Boot.dev's free-to-audit computer science program for backend developers.](https://boot.dev)

## FAQ

### Where is the HTML, CSS & React?

**This is not a front-end program.** That said, we've had front-end engineers who still complete some of the courses and projects for the sake of learning the computer science content. We have no immediate plans for purely front-end technologies in this curriculum.

### Can I skip ahead?

**You shouldn't skip ahead unless you really know what you are doing**. Some people are comfortable skipping the first course, "Learn Python" because it is for beginners. Almost nothing else should be skipped because the rest of the content builds upon itself.

### Do I need to take the courses in the Python, JavaScript and Go languages?

For now, yes. **Learning several programming languages is critical to your success.** It's not nearly as hard to pick up a second programming language after you're familiar with your first one, yet it offers many benefits. You can [read more here](https://blog.boot.dev/education/learn-multiple-programming-languages) if you're skeptical.

### Should I get started even though the program is not "complete"?

**Yes you should get started - this program will always be improving and never be "complete".** This curriculum will never be "complete" in the same sense the YouTube will never be "complete" - there is new content all the time. We care deeply about the quality of this program and will always be improving and adding to it.

### Will Boot.dev help me find my first job?

**We help you prepare for your first development job, but we won't match you with a company**. We go one step further than universities. We provide education that teaches you how to become a backend developer and education about how to find a job. That said, we don't actually do the "finding" for you.

### Is Boot.dev free?

The first two chapters of every course are completely free, and the entire curriculum is free to *read*. We call this read-only mode "sandbox mode". In sandbox mode, you won't be able to pass off assignments without [becoming a patron](https://boot.dev/pricing) to support ongoing development.

### üí° Features and goals

#### Hands-on, project based

[We believe in learning by building](https://blog.boot.dev/about). We mix guided and unguided content. Every *guided course* is a collection of coding assignments and quizzes designed to teach a set of concepts. Every *unguided project* is a blueprint for students to build an entire application on their local machines.

#### Linear curriculum

The majority of students should have a *simple and straight* path to completion, without needing to make many choices about which courses to take next.

#### Modern tech stack

The tech stack should be *fairly* lean. The goal of Boot.dev is to teach the *concepts* of CS without *forcing* students to learn too many languages, frameworks and tools. For this reason, the primary languages of Boot.dev are currently:

* Python
* JavaScript
* Go
