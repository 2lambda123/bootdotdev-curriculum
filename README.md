# Boot.dev's computer science curriculum

This is the roadmap for [Boot.dev's free-to-audit computer science program](https://boot.dev). 

* Courses with links have already been released
* All courses are free to audit, meaning you can read all the material and interact within a "coding sandbox"
* Hit the project with a star if you find it useful ‚≠ê
* Please leave feedback in the form of issues here on Github

### üí° Features and goals

#### Hands-on, project based

[We believe in learning by building](https://blog.boot.dev/about). We mix guided and unguided content. Every *guided course* is a collection of coding assignments and quizzes designed to teach a set of concepts. Every *unguided project* is a blueprint for students to build entire applications on their local machines which teaches practicality.

#### Linear curriculum

The majority of students should have a *simple and straight* path to completion, without needing to make many choices about which courses to take.

#### Modern tech stack

The tech stack should be *fairly* lean. The goal of Boot.dev is to teach the *concepts* of CS without *forcing* students to learn too many languages, frameworks and tools. For this reason, the primary languages of Boot.dev are currently:

* JavaScript
* Go
* Python
